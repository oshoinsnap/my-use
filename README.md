## File Structure

```
email-tools/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.py          # Vercel serverless entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Main web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json          # Vercel deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ email_name_merger.py # Name merging tool
â”œâ”€â”€ seprate.py          # Industry splitter tool
â”œâ”€â”€ cleaner.py          # Email cleaning tool

## Usage

1. Visit the deployed website or run locally
2. Choose the tool that fits your needs
3. Upload your Excel/CSV file
4. Configure any required parameters
5. Click process and download your results

## Limitations on Vercel

- File size limits (typically 5MB for uploads)
- Processing time limits (10 seconds for hobby plan)
- No persistent file storage (files are temporary)
- DNS validation may be slower due to serverless cold starts

For large files or heavy processing, consider running locally or using a VPS deployment.
